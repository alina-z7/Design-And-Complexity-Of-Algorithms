This repository encompasses assignments, projects, and code related to COMP 363, offering insights into algorithm design, complexity analysis, and problem-solving skills.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing COMP 363, I have achieved the following:

- Thorough understanding of algorithm design and complexity analysis principles
- Application of various algorithmic techniques to solve computational problems efficiently
- Proficiency in coding and implementing algorithms in Python and other languages

## Course Outline

The undergraduate course in algorithms comprises the following topics:

- **Unit 1:** Tools and techniques. Python, the Markdown markup language, LaTeX (another markup language), discrete mathematics. Upper bound notation (big-oh notation). Example of a simple algorithm: Newton’s method to find.
- **Unit 2:** String alignment. Problems with optimal substructure. From brute force with nearly infinite scenarios to practical solutions that can be delivered in polynomial time.
- **Unit 3:** Recurrence relations. Divide and Conquer techniques. Derivation of the Master Theorem. Good recursion. Bad recursion. Factorial and Fibonacci computations. Multiplying very large integers.
- **Unit 4:** Memoization and Dynamic Programming. 0/1 Knapsack (or, how to plan a museum heist). Minimum Weight Independent Set.
- **Unit 5:** Simple graphs. Review of graph definition and basic properties. Graph types. Parts of a graph. Representing a graph with arrays. Graph traversals. Stack v. queue-based traversals of a graph. Labeling and counting components.
- **Unit 6:** Minimum spanning trees. Boruvka’s algorithm. Relaxing tense edges. Correctness and complexity considerations. Evolution of Boruvka to Kruskal, Dijkstra, and other variations.
- **Unit 7:** Directed graphs. Adjacency matrix. Determining the reachability of a vertex. Shortest paths. Detecting cycles.
- **Unit 8:** Maximum flows and minimum cuts or why Chicago is a more valuable strategic target than NYC.
- **Unit 9:** Greedy algorithms: Huffman encoding.
- **Unit 10:** Topological ordering.
- **Unit 11:** P versus NP and complexity theory. The SAT3 problem.
